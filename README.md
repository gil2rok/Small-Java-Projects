# Processing-Java-Projects
A collection of small(ish) projects made in Processing

Here is what each project does:
Double_Pendulem -- visual simulation replicating the physics of a double pendulem
Drawing_Knots -- drawing knots in 3d space based off of their mathematical equations
Flying_Over_Mountains -- simulation of mountains that appear as if the viewer is flying over them
Fractal_Circles -- recursively draw fractal circles
HackerRank_Basic_Stats -- writing out some basic code for a hacker rank problem
Matrix_Code -- try to recreate the famous green, vertical code that appears in the movie The Matrix
Monte_Carlo_Pi_Calculation -- calculate pi through monte carlo methodology by 'throwing darts' in a circle inscribed in a square
Pixelated_Turok -- take the cover art from the video game Turok and make it pixelated
Sudoku_1_1 - input a sudoku puzzle and automatically solve it on the computer
Triple_Pendulem -- visual simulation replicating the physics of a triple pendulem (not yet completed)

Some of these projects are based on code from the Youtube channel The Coding Train.
